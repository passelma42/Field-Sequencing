# Intro  

Field sequencing outside of a lab environment is currently made possible by [Oxford Nanopore technologies](https://nanoporetech.com/).  
Combining the portable sequencer called 'MinION Mk1B' and a powerfull laptop with some GPU power under the hood one is able to do 'Field Sequencing'.
The idea of this website is to setup a portable field sequencing workflow covering following topics:  
 
- GPU system setup  
- Installing software (including ONT sequencing software)  
- Using `BLAST`and different databases for taxonomical ID  
- Wet lab approach for barcoding applications
- Demo of our field sequencing test at Botanic Garden Ghent  


This is a step by step guide that will empower you to set up a compute workstation and learn all necessary protocols for both wet and dry lab.
