# wf-amplicon  
This workflow performs the analysis of reads generated from PCR amplicons. After some pre-processing, reads are either aligned to a reference (containing the expected sequence for each amplicon) for variant calling or the ampliconâ€™s consensus sequence is generated *de novo*.  
Installation guides for wf-amplicon can be found here: [Installation guide](https://labs.epi2me.io/workflows/wf-amplicon/).
